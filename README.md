# Introduction

This project is a chat Application in which multiple users can connect and chat in real time.

# Description
Messaging apps are increasing in popularity. Past few years have brought apps like Whatsapp,Telegram etc. Such applications are surrounding us. Messages are sent in an instant and you get real-time feedback. I tried to implement the same functionality and this was the motivation of the project.
It may sound rather complicated without knowing how it works, but in reality, socket.io makes things super convenient.
